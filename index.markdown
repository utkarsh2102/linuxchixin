You do not need to know Go, be a professional developer or enjoy talking to strangers in order to come hang out with us! 
<br /><br />  This group is for you if you are interested in Go, and are looking for a safe space to learn.. 
<br /><br />   We would love for you to speak at Women Who Go! Contact 
<a href="delhi@womenwhogo.org">delhi@womenwhogo.org</a> about a short talk, demo, or whatever you have in mind!
